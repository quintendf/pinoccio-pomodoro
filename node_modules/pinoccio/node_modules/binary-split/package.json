  "readme": "# binary-split\n\nSplit streams of binary data. Similar to [split](http://npmjs.org/split) but for [bops](http://npmjs.org/bops), e.g. Buffers in node or Uint8Arrays in the browser. Whereas split is String specific, this library never converts binary data into non-binary data.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/binary-split.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/binary-split/)\n\n## how fast is it?\n\non a SSD w/ a Haswell i5 1.3ghz CPU and 4GB RAM reading a 2.6GB, 5.2 million entry line delimited JSON file takes 15 seconds. using `split` for the same benchmark takes 1m23s.\n\n## usage\n\n```\nvar split = require('binary-split')\n```\n\n#### split(splitOn)\n\nReturns a stream. You can `.pipe` other streams to it or `.write` them yourself (if you `.write` don't forget to `.end`)\n\nThe stream will emit a stream of binary objects representing the split data.\n\nPass in the optional `splitOn` argument to specify where to split the data. The default is your current operating systems EOL sequence (via `require('os').EOL`).\n\nFor more examples of usage see `test.js`\n\n### license\n\nBSD\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.
